            Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton 
            "architect", from ἀρχι- "chief" and τέκτων "creator") is both the process 
            and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other 
            structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are 
            often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical 
            civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural 
            achievements.
        </P>
    <br>
        <P>
            The practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a way 
            of expressing culture for civilizations on all seven continents. Texts on 
            architecture have been written since ancient times. The earliest surviving 
            text on architectural theory is the 1st century AD treatise De 
            architectura by the Roman architect Vitruvius, according to whom a good 
            building embodies firmitas, utilitas, and venustas (durability, utility, 
            and beauty). Centuries later, Leon Battista Alberti developed his ideas 
            further, seeing beauty as an objective quality of buildings to be found 
            in their proportions. Giorgio Vasari wrote Lives of the Most Excellent 
            Painters, Sculptors, and Architects and put forward the idea of style 
            in the Western arts in the 16th century. In the 19th century, Louis 
            Sullivan declared that "form follows function". "Function" began to 
            replace the classical "utility" and was understood to include not only 
            practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural dimensions. 
            Sustainable architecture was introduced in the late 20th 
            century.

                Celebrating 30 years since our founding in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, we
                have evolved but our essentials remain unchanged. The projects are
                recognizable: thoughtful, innovative, and refined in their details. A
                collaborative process enables us to engage clients and therefore our
                portfolio is loaded with a diverse set of designs each responsive to a
                particular set of conditions. The power of landscape, the quality of
                light and the simple honesty of vernacular architecture influence the
                work. Each endeavor is guided with the firm's philosophy in mind –
                inspired by place and has resulted in projects across the United States.
            </P>

                Since our inception in 1992, the Jackson studio has grown to accommodate
                a staff of more than 40 led by partners Eric Logan, Kevin Burke, Andy
                Ankeny, and Darcey Prichard. We maintain an informal and collegial
                atmosphere that encourages individual creativity and teamwork in an
                open, collaborative environment.

                In 2017 we opened a full-service design studio in Bozeman. Our design
                approach integrates well with the landscape and cultural context of
                southwestern Montana. We are thrilled to be contributing to the
                collection of legacy buildings in this familiar environment.
