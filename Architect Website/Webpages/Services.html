        <P>
            Architects, engineers, designers, contractors, and other industry
            professionals are needed to complete many building projects. Our
            approach is always open, honest and reciprocal as relationships are the
            key to any successful collaborative project.
        </P>
    <br>
        <H3 style="color: #305c80">
            Open
        </H3>
    <br>
        <P>
            Darroch says "We are a pretty open office really; a project may have
            input from any number of us as it progresses. I am there to lead,
            mentor, provide oversight, and also 'do'. Depending on the assignment
            others may lead it and do the lion's share. At the end of the day though
            it comes back to my desk before finally going to the client." We have
            clients and industry professionals who drop in just because they like
            to. We like that – it is very satisfying when people feel comfortable
            enough to be spontaneous and 'swing by'.
        </P>
    <br>
        <H3 style="color: #305c80">
            Client Focused
        </H3>
    <br>
        <P>
            We are satisfied when you are satisfied. A good design to us is one that
            is well rounded in providing both a sound technical solution while also
            presenting some design flair. "For truly good design there is no
            substitute for hours and experience" says Darroch "Think of it this way
            – we go through many options on paper so you only have to build one."
        </P>
    <br>
        <P>
            "Every client has different needs and priorities so our work reflects
            that. It is their building after all when we are gone so they should
            feel that their needs are met. It is opposite to making every client fit
            your mold.
        </P>

            Effective
        </H3>
    <br>
        <P>
            In this market the majority of our customers are seeking cost effective
            solutions that are lasting and look good. "We aim for that every day"
            says Darroch: "Your first conversation with us will be about scope and
            budget and we are generally quite budget driven. It is a waste of our
            time and yours to start somewhere else".
