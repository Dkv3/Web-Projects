            Gosha, otherwise known as "Big Floppa," was born on December 21, 2017 in 
            Kyiv, Ukraine. In April 2018, he was adopted by Andrey Bondarev and Elena 
            Bondareva from Moscow. Andrey and Elena also own a housecat named 
            Justin (Russian: Жора, Zhora), who is 4 years older than Gosha and shares 
            a room with him. Gosha enjoys eating shrimp and mice and is very active 
            around his apartment.

            Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, many social media have 
            been banned in Russia, including Instagram, where Gosha's owners typically 
            post. In response to this, a post was made on their instagram page 
            which read "Dear friends, today Instagram will be blocked in Russia, but
            we remain with you!". Soon after this announcement, they also 
            announced the creation of a 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqwm75qcl8MH6hgBxNkawTg" target="New Window">YouTube channel</a>
             and a Telegram channel. Gosha's YouTube channel, called 'Big Floppa Official' 
            hosts livestreams of Gosha with various webcams around Andrey and Elena's 
            house. As of March 2022, Gosha's channel has 17.2k subscribers.
